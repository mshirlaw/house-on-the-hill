2 Lie still, carefully listening for noises
3 Sigh loudly, hoping to hear a response
4 Jump up from the bed and run as fast as you can towards the light
5 Scream "Who's there?" with all of the authority that you can muster

You awake inside a room. It is pitch black. You can't see anything but you sense that there is someone else in the room with you. You take a deep breath. A foul odour that you have never smelt before pierces your nostrils. You think you can see a light in front of you but it's so dark you aren't completely sure. It could be your eyes playing tricks on you. 
What do you do?

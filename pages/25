Hesitantly, you climb into the back seat of the car and the man closes the door behind you. The man gets back into the car and it begins to move off. You realise that there is a second man driving the vehicle. The man who opened the door leans into the back seat as if to pick something up from the floor in front of you and as he does so you immediately realise the gravity of the situation that you are in. On the man's forearm is a tattoo of an emblem that you saw on the front door of the house. The man points a gun in your direction and says, "Where do you think you are going? We aren't finished with you yet".
The end!

4 Climb out of the bed and move towards the light at the door
6 Turn your head towards the direction of the noise, hoping to hear it again
7 Carefully sit up on the edge of the bed, waiting to see what happens

You let out a long sigh, "aggghhhhhhh..." Just as you feel the last of the breath leaving your lungs you hear a faint noise in the distance. You can't quite make out what it was but you think it was coming from an adjacent room. Your eyes are also beginning to adjust to the dark and you realise that the light that you saw before is coming from a distant door which is slightly ajar. 
What do you do next?

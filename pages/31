"There is no time," the man shouts. He begins to back away into the car and you feel an uneasy sensation that someone or something is moving towards you from behind. You see the expression on the man's face change to one of horror as he backs away and he only manages one word before he jumps into the car and speeds off, "RUN!" You turn your head and catch a glimpse of a pack of black, ghost like figures on horseback approaching at an impossible speed. As you look towards the figures on horseback you are transfixed by their eyes... red... glowing in the dark night sky and there is no doubt in your mind that they are not human.
The end!

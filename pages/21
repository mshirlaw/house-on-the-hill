You squeeze hard on the trigger and open fire. At that exact moment, the door slams open and you see the sillouette of a person in the door frame. Once, twice, three times you squeeze the trigger and each time you feel the gun recoil in your hand. The sound of the bullets leaving the chamber seem to get louder with every shot. The figure in the doorway slumps over and starts to fall towards the floor. You realise the figure in front of you is female as she lets out a chilling scream. Your heart sinks. The woman reaches for the light and flicks the switch as she falls. A bright light fills the room and you immediately realise what you have done. The look on your mother's face as she slumps towards the floor is something that will haunt you for the rest of your life...
The end!

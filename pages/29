"What is the House on the Hill? Who owns it? Why was I there?" you demand. The man looks nervous but understands that you need answers before you will trust him. "It is thought to be empty," he remarks. "At least, that is what we are told by local law enforcement. Those of us who have lived in the area for a long time know the truth. There are not many people who have been to the House on the Hill and have lived to tell their story." The man looks around nervously and then adds, "We must hurry away from here. They will be looking for you."

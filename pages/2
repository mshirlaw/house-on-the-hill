3 Sigh loudly, hoping to hear a response 
6 Turn your head towards the direction of the noise, hoping to hear it again 

You lie completely still. You try not to move a single muscle in your body and you attempt to slow your breathing even further. Suddenly, to your left, you hear a faint scratching noise but it stops as quickly as it began. You lie still again and wait. Just as you are beginning to think that you imagined it, you hear it again. It sounds like it is coming from the room next door. 
What do you do next?

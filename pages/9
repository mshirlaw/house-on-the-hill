2 Lie still, carefully listening for noises
23 Run for the door

You stand up and take a step away from the door. You draw your leg back and with every inch of strength that you can find, you run towards the door, kicking it open in one action. You crash through the door into the most blinding light that you have ever seen and trip and stumble to the ground hitting your head with intense force. You almost pass out from the pain and it takes a minute for you to compose yourself. You notice that there is another door across the room which appears to open to the ouside world.
What do you do next?

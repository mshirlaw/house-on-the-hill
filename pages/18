8 Quietly exit through the main door in the room to find another way inside
9 Step back, use your momentum to kick open the trapdoor

You get up and move in the direction of the sound. It seems to be coming from an adjacent room. You place both hands on the wall opposite and feel your way along the wall, looking for any way out. As you move carefully along the wall, feeling up and down, you come across a narrow ledge sticking out from the wall. As your eyes begin to adjust a little more you can just make out a window sill. The window is black, it has been covered by dark paper or painted to prevent light from entering. Just below the window is a small door, almost like a trapdoor. Again, you hear a faint scratching sound coming from the room next door so you try the trapdoor. It is locked tight but you are cetain it will lead to the source of the scratching. 
What next?

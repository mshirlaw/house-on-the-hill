4 Jump up and run as fast as you can towards the door
11 Grab the gun and point it at the door, waiting for it to open

You use the object that you are holding to mimic the pattern that you hear "scratch... tap, tap, tap... scratch..." and almost immediately you hear footsteps approaching from the adjacent room. Your heart starts beating faster and faster and you begin to panic. Who is approaching? Are they dangerous? You grab the object that you are holding with both hands and are shocked to realise that it feels very much like a gun. You move your hand over the object and the truth hits you like a tonne of bricks. You have been holding a gun all along. 
What will you do?

26 Refuse to get in the car
27 Ask the man who he is
28 Get up and run

You run from the house as fast as you can, you keep running until your feet hurt and you can run no more. As you move further and further away from the house you realise you are running down hill across a field covered by low shrubs and rocks. You have no idea where this place is but as soon as you are aware that there is no one following you, you begin to feel more at ease and only after you can no longer even see the house behind you do you slow down and begin to walk. After walking for about half an hour you come to a dirt road and collapse in exhaustion. Just as you think you might fall asleep you become aware of an approaching car. As it pulls up beside you, a man opens the door and tells you to get in. You feel a little uneasy but know you must make a choice. 
What do you do?

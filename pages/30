You agree to move on and climb into the car. The man slams the door behind you, starts the car and moves away without any hesitation. As the car pulls away, you sit up and look through the window to your left. In the distance you see a group of shadows which look like men on horseback in the distance. The shadowy figures stop their pursuit and some of them start to turn and head back towards the house. At the front of the group, a large black figure begins to dismount and you catch a glimpse of his red glowing eyes in the darkness. Your driver turns to you as the figures fade into the distance and says, "You are safe now!"
The end!

17 Mimmic the pattern
18 Get up slowly and move towards the source of the sound
19 Investigate the object that you are holding in your hand

You grab the object on the bed next to you and move it towards the wall, using it to mimmic the scratching sound that you heard coming from the other room. You scratch the object on the wall "scratch... scratch... scratch..." and then you wait. After a few seconds you hear the scratch again. This time you recognise a pattern "scratch... tap, tap, tap... scratch..." Someone is definitely attempting to communicate with you. 
How do you respond?

16 Return to the house and try to find out where you are
23 Exit the house as quickly as you can

Hesitantly, you push open the door. Light floods the room and you can now clearly see your surroundings. The bed you were sleeping in has no covers, and it's stained and dirty. There is another bed in the other corner of the room and you are suspicious that it could be occupied but you waste no time trying to confim this and move quickly into the adjacent room. The adjacent room is empty but a fire is buring in the corner and the warmth radiating from it makes you instantly aware of how cold you are. Across the room is a large, arch shaped door. On the door is an emblem that you recognise but you can't quite remember why. You run towards it, grab the handle and push the heavy wooden door open. As the door swings open you feel a rush of cold air from the outside world. 
What next?

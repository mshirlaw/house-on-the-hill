You lie still, feeling the cold, gun like object in your hand and wait. The footsteps get louder and louder and you realise that the person will soon be in the room with you. You wonder whether it was a good idea to scream at all? Just as you are about to be overcome with fear, the door to the room in which you are sleeping pushes open and a bright light forms a sillouette around the figure at the door. The figure flicks a light switch and you instantly know where you are. Your mother looks at you and questions "What happened? Why are you screaming? And what the hell are you doing with the TV remote?"
The end!

9 Kick open the door
23 Exit the house as quickly as you can

You pull the door closed and turn around to walk back inside to try and determine where you are. You figure it would be much too dangerous to walk out into the night with absolutely no idea where you are or where you are going. And besides, you can't shake this strange feeling that there is something that you need to do in this house before you leave. As you look around the room you suddenly hear a faint scratching noise once again. It sounds like the noise is coming from an adjacent room. Across the room you see another smaller door which leads to a room that you didn't notice earlier. As you get closer to the door, you hear more scratching and a faint wimpering sound that sounds like someone calling for help. You have to make a choice. 
What will you do?

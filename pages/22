You move towards the sleeping figure carefully and reach out in the direction of the bed. Just before you are able to put your hand on the other person's shoulder to wake them, a woman rolls over and her eyes snap open. You are so startled that you stagger backwards crashing to the floor, hitting your head on the corner of the bed as you fall. The pain is excruciating and you feel a warm sensation behind your neck as a pool of blood begins to gather beneath you. Just as you begin to lose consciousness, you see the figure of the sleeping woman rise from the bed and begin to approach you. In her hand she is holiding what looks like a large knife...
The end!

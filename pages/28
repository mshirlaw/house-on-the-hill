You jump to your feet, your legs are so tired they can barely get you upright. You start to run as fast as you can in the opposite direction of the road. You feel every muscle in your body and you are tripping over your feet as you run. Before you have made it more than about ten steps you hear the distinct crack of gun fire disrupt the otherwise quiet night sky and moments later you feel a burning sensation in your lower back. You immediately fall to the ground in excruciating pain and the man is soon above you. "No one escapes from the House on the Hill alive", he barks at you.
The end!

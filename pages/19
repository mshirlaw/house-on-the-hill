You move the object in your hands feeling each smooth edge wondering exactly what it is. The more you move it around in your grip the more you begin to think that it feels like a gun. The thought of holding a gun in your hand starts to concern you. Why is there a gun in the room? Where did it come from? Who does it belong too? Just as you start to consider these questions, you are startled by a sound. 
Are those footsteps?

4 Carefully climb out of bed and move towards the light at the door
22 Wake the sleeping person

You sit on the edge of the bed and wait. You wait for what seems like hours but in reality is probably only a few short seconds. The longer you wait, the more your eyes seem to adjust to the darkness. Your surroundings start to become clearer and you look around the room for any hints about your location. To your left you can just barely make out another bed and your heart nearly skips a beat when you realise that there is another person sleeping in the bed. The foul odour that you smelled earlier seems to have gone away but you are transfixed on the other person in the room with you.

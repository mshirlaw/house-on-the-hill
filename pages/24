You pull the trigger and begin firing in the direction of your captor as you continue to back away from the room. You see the man slump over and you fall backwards into the adjacent room. As you fall you hear screaming and shouting coming from all around you and a large wooden door to the outside world crashes open. An entire team of soldiers barge into the room and grab you, dragging you to the door. One of the men looks towards you and smiles, "We've been looking for you my friend. You're safe now. We've got you".
The end!

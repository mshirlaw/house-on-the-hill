4 Jump up from the bed and run as fast as you can towards the light
14 Use the object on the bed to scratch on the wall
15 Pick up the object and feel it with both hands

You turn your head ever so slightly, hoping that the shift in body position will allow you hear a little better. Just as you turn, you hear it again "scratch... scratch... scratch..." It sounds as if someone or something is trying to communicate. You move your hand around you, feeling in the dark as you go. Your hand brushes something cold and hard on the bed next to you. You keep reaching to your right and notice that the bed is pushed up against a wall on your right side. 
What do you do?

11 Point the gun at the door
13 Lie still in anticipation of the approaching footsteps
20 Grab the gun and move towards the corner of the room

You take the object in both hands and move it around. It feels smooth and metalic, almost like a gun. You start to feel alarmed and wonder where you are and why there is a gun on the bed with you. Before you have time to process this, you hear approaching footsteps. As your eyes adjust, you can clearly see that the light in the room is coming from a door at the end of the room. 
How will you respond?

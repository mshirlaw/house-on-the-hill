4 Jump up from the bed and run as fast as you can towards the light
11 Grab the gun and point it at the door
12 Squint through the darkness towards the light, listening to the approaching footsteps
13 Lie still in anticipation of the aproaching footsteps

You scream at the top of your lungs, demanding to know who is in the room with you. A dog barks. You hear foot steps in the distance and they appear to be getting closer. You can't be sure where they are coming from. Your heart is beating faster and faster and you begin to panic. You move your right hand and feel something cold and hard on the bed next to you. You fumble in the dark and your heart stops when you realise that the object that you are holding feels like a gun. 
What do you do next?

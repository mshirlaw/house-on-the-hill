23 Run
24 Open fire

You grab the gun and move towards the corner of the room and hide, almost frozen with fear at the sound of the approaching footsteps. The door bursts open, you are almost blinded by the light that enters the room and you then recognise a man of at least 6'6" standing in the door way. The man rushes into the room. You make an attempt to back away out of the main door but he has seen you. Your fight or flight response takes over.

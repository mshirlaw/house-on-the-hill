24 Open fire
23 Run

You lie completely still and squint through the darkness at the light waiting for the door to open. As the footsteps get closer and closer you begin to formulate a plan. As the door bursts open you see the figure of a man standing in the door way. In the low light, he looks to be at least 6'6" tall and he appears to be holding a gun. He enters the room and to your surprise he moves quickly towards the corner opposite you. You hear him speak aggressively in a foreign language and see him turn his back to you and hit what appears to be another person with the back of his gun. The other body in the room doesn't move. Now's your chance. You jump from the bed and crash tackle the man to the floor. You grab his gun and back away quickly towards the door. 
You have only a few seconds to react.
